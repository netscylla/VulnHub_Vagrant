Description:
    GreenOptic is my fourth Capture the Flag box. It is rated as ‘Very Hard’. As with all of my CTFs, please run this in ‘Host Only’ mode – it does not need an internet connection.
    Don’t let the difficulty put you off though – the CTF is designed to be realistic, so you won’t come across anything you wouldn’t experience in a real environment.
    You will need to enumerate this box very well, and likely chain together different bits of information and vulnerabilities in order to gain access.
Synopsis
    British Internet Service Provider GreenOptic has been subject to a large scale Cyber Attack. Over 5 million of their customer records have been stolen, along with credit card information and bank details.
    GreenOptic have created an incident response team to analyse the attack and close any security holes. Can you break into their server before they fix their security holes?
