Description:
    The company Aquarium Life S.L. has contacted you to perform a pentest against one of their machines. They suspect that one of their employees has been committing fraud selling fake tickets. They want you to break into his computer, escalate privileges and search for any evidences that proves this behaviour.
ZIP Password: EsSabad0!
Extra information:
    The suspicious username is Squiddie.
    He was in charge of the ticket selling for the Aquarium.
    Ethernet settings set to NAT with DHCP enabled.
    You should find the IP in your VLAN.
    The idea of the machine it is not just to gain root privileges but obtaining all the evidences to prove that the user was commiting fraud.
    Difficulty: I would say the machine is Medium regarding gaining root privileges. If we consider all the steps to obtain the evidences, Hard.
