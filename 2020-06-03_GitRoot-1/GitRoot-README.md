Description:
    The theme of this box is git.
    The design of this box is HTB-like.
    I will NOT be giving hints. Like a wise man once said "Try Harder"
    Goals:
        Get a low privilege shell and read /home/pablo/user.txt
        Get a root shell and read /root/root.txt
    Difficulty: Intermediate
    This box only works on VirtualBox
    DHCP is enabled
    All of the users on this box are named after my teachers and mentors, thank you Pablo, Beth, and Jen.
    Have Fun!
    This works better with VirtualBox than VMware
