Description:
    A very Easy Box for beginners, I recommend this box if you are new here. Your task is to grab all the 3 flags (user1.txt, user2.txt, proof.txt).
    I checked it on VirtualBox with "NAT NETWORK", not on VMware so i don't know if it is working with VMware too.
    Please share your feedback: "https://twitter.com/Anant_chauhan" (infinity)
This works better with VIrtualBox rather than VMware.
