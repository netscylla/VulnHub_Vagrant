Description:
    This is an easy box, to pass your time.
    It's vmware based, i dont know if it works on VB you can test it if you want.
    There are 2 flags under /home/$user/user.txt & /root/root.txt.
    No stupid ctfy/guessy stuff, basic enumeration will give you what you want!
    Tip: You can't get a root shell, you just have to read the root flag.
    Happy pwning! :D
