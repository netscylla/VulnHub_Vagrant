Description:
    The Presidential Elections within the USA are just around the corner (November 2020). One of the political parties is concerned that the other political party is going to perform electoral fraud by hacking into the registration system, and falsifying the votes.
    The state of Ontario has therefore asked you (an independent penetration tester) to test the security of their server in order to alleviate any electoral fraud concerns. Your goal is to see if you can gain root access to the server â€“ the state is still developing their registration website but has asked you to test their server security before the website and registration system are launched.
    This CTF was created and has been tested with VirtualBox. It should also be compatible with VMWare and is DHCP enabled.
