    I do not own the characters and the elements of LOTR. They was used for the fanfiction story during the CTF. I do not earn money with this machine and all the other elements of this machine.
    If you use parts of this machine please ensure that you remove all LOTR elements.
    May work better in VIrtualBox than VMware. ## Changelog: 1.1 - 2020/01/07 1.0 - 2019/09/05
