Description:
    An easy to intermediate, TIGER KING themed boot2root.
    Why is this "Tiger King" themed!? Well I decided to put my first CTF together, and needed some ideas for the blog.
    Lo and behold, Joe Exotic appeared on TV and thus, this CTF was made.
    Can you help Joe escape from prison?
    There are no off the shelf exploits here, and bruteforcing will get you nowhere. You will need to perform manual investigation and enumeration.
    Multiple ways to achieve root, ranging from beginner to medium difficulty.
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
