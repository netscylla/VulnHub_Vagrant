Description:
    Difficulty: easy/medium
    That's the first machine I developed. I tried to make use of more realistic techniques and then include them in a single machine. Keep in mind it's still just a CTF. It's meant to be rather easy. Can you take advantage of the misconfigurations made by The Shuriken Company? See you in the root.
