Description:
    Difficulty: easy/medium
    After the last breach, The Shuriken Company decided to move and rebuild its infrastructure. This time using different technology, and assuring us it's gonna be secure. Will it be so? It's up to you to prove otherwise.
    My main focus is to not make the machines typical CTF like riddles but at least a bit more realistic. Remember it's a custom machine after all.
    This machine was tested with VirtualBox.
    See you in the root.
    Hint: For the foothold, it's important to understand the technology behind the web app and how it handles user input.
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
