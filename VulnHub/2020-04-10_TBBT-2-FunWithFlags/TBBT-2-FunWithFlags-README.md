    Welcome to "Fun with Flags" 2!
    This boot2root machine is part of the TBBT Fun with Flags series and it is themed after the famous TV show, The Big Bang Theory and has really strong CTF elements. It's more like solving a set of interesting CTF challenges as a puzzle than facing these in a real life scenario.
    Goal: Hack Sheldon and get user and root flags
    Difficulty: Intermediate but if you have never watched the series I would rate it as hard, still solvable though
    Runs only with VirtualBox!
    DHCP is enabled

    Your feedback is really valuable for me!
    Was there something that you didnâ€™t like about it? Maybe something you have liked more if it was different?
    Good luck and have fun :)
    This will only work with VirtualBox (and not VMware).
