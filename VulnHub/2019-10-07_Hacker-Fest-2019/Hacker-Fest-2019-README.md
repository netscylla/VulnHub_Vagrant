    Date release: 07 Oct 2019
    Author: Martin Haller
    Series: Hacker Fest

Description:
    The machine was part of my workshop for Hacker Fest 2019 at Prague.
    Difficulty level of this VM is very “very easy”. There are two paths for exploit it.
    There are no intentional rabbit holes.
    Through a vulnerable "[retracted]". Exploit is part of MSF.
    Through vulnerable "[retracted]".
        Can be found by "[retracted]".
        There is a "[retracted]" injection (exploit is part of MSF).
        Recovered credentials (username + hash) can be cracked by John and rockyou.txt wordlist.
        Low priv shell can be gained through MSF exploit or trying the credentials against "[retracted]".
        Priv. esc. is simply done by "[retracted]".
    It works better in VirtualBox than VMware. - .OVA = VirtualBox file - .ZIP = Hyper-V VM (v5)
