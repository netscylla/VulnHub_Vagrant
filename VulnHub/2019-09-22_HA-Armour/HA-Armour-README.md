Description:
    Klaw has stolen some armours from the Avengers Super-Secret Base. Falcon has checked the manifest, following things are unaccountable:
    HulkBuster Armour
    Spiderman Armour
    Ant-Man Armour
    Black Panther Armour
    Iron Man Armour
    Klaw hide all these armours and now it's up to you. Can you use your penetration skills to recover them all?
    -Captain Steve Rogers
    P.S. Klaw has a habit of dividing his passwords into 3 parts and save them at different locations. So, if you get some combine them to move forward.
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
