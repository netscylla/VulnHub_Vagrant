    Dwight Schrute devised a system (called the Doomsday Device) to find mistakes made by employees in the office. It will forward incriminating emails to Robert California if employees make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. Your goal is to find your way into the system and save everyone's job by getting root access.
