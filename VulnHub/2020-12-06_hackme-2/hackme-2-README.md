About Release:
    Name: hackme: 2
    Date release: 06 Dec 2020

    Series: hackme

Description:
    'hackme2' is a medium difficulty level box. This is the second part of the hackme series where more controls are in place do deter malicious attacks. In addition, you will have to think out of the box to exploit the vulnerabilites. The goal is to gain limited privilege access via web vulnerabilities and subsequently, privilege escalate as a root user. The lab was created to mimic real world web vulnerabilities.
    'hackme2' uses DHCP and in the possible event that the mysqld shuts down on its own (very rare cases), attempt to force restart the machine and it should be working fine subsequently.
