  Series: Funbox

Description:
  Boot2Root ! This is a reallife szenario, but easy going. You have to enumerate and understand the szenario to get the root-flag in round about 20min. This VM is created/tested with Virtualbox. Maybe it works with vmware. If you need hints, call me on twitter: @0815R2d2. Have fun... This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
