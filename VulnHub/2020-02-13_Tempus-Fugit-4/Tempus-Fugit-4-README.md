    Story:
    After being hacked multiple times, the company decides to do things differently this time. They left Linux and choose another operating system that claimed to be more secure. Realising they could have resources inside the company that are willing to help the relative small IT department (originally only web-designers) and the fact (according to Hugh Janus) there are safety in numbers, they start a internal crowdsourcing project. Allowing internal employees to request access to the new server.
