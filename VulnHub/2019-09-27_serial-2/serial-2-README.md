Description:
    This box has an intermediate difficulty for the user, I suggest you to enumerate it and use some tools for get the first flag. Note that if you don't see the flag maybe you should find it in other place ;).
    The hard part is the privilege escalation for the root user, try hard and get the root flag (if you can;))!
    If you need an hint, feel free to contact me on Twitter: @sk4pwn
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
