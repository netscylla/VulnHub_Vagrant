Description:
  This is an easy level VM with some rabbitholes. Enumeration is key to find your way in. There are three flags (2 user and 1 root flag). The VM is tested on Virtualbox. After the startup it shows the IP address. Share your rootflag with me on Twitter: @roelvb79 Good luck and have fun! This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
