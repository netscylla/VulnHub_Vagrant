    Hint: Maybe, you hasted and left some open holes unchecked?
    Literally Vulnerable is supposed to give beginners a taste of real-world scenarios and OSCP machines at the same time! It was inspired highly by the @DC series.
    You're supposed to know the big three (EEEs) Enumeration, Exploitation & Escalation of pentesting to pwn the machine. The machine is supposed to be beginner-friendly and the difficulty level is Easy-Intermediate depending on your knowledge. You need to have enough information about Linux file types & permissions for privileges escalation.
    Technical Information:
    Just download, extract and load the .vmx file in VMware Workstation (tested on VMware Workstation 15.x.x)
    The adapter is currently NAT, networking is configured for DHCP and IP will get assigned automatically

    You can either contact me on twitter @syed__umar or linkedin (/in/syedumararfeen/) for hints!
    There are three flags in the machine: local.txt, user.txt & root.txt. You're supposed to grab all three in order to completely pwn the machine. Hope you like the machine, best of luck! :)
    I'll try my best to continue with the series!
