    Series: wpwn

Description:
    This is an easy box.
    It's vmware based, i dont know if it works on VB you can test it if you want.
    There are 2 flags under /home/$user/user.txt & /root/root.txt.
    No stupid ctfy/guessy stuff.
    Remember: your goal is to read the root flag, not just to take a root shell. Feel free to DM me on discord for any tip/hint.
    Happy pwning! :D
