Description:
    This is my first vulnerable virtual machine called fishymail. You can download it here load the .vdi up on VirtualBox and give it a try. Feel free to contact me or leave a comment if you have any questions or need some help troubleshooting.
    This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware
