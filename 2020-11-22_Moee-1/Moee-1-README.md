    Welcome to Moomin's World, one of the best cartoons from the 90's in Nepal. In order to solve this box you require knowledge about the linux command, basic penetration testing along with the tools required during pentesting. Side-by knowledge about the linux process or daemon with some OSINT might come handy and the last part will be some basic concept of Binary Exploitation and the tools required to get your things done.
