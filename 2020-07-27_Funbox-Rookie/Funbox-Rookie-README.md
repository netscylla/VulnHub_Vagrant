Description:
    Boot2Root ! This can be a real life scenario if rockies becomes admins. Easy going in round about 15 mins. Bit more, if you are find and stuck in the rabbit-hole first.
    This VM is created/tested with Virtualbox. Maybe it works with vmware.
    If you need hints, call me on twitter: @0815R2d2
    Have fun...
    This works better with VirtualBox, rather than VMware
