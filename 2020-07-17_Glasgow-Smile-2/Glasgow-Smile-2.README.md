    Are you ready for Glasgow Smile 2? GS2 follows the philosophy of Glasgow Smile. It's a CTF vs OSCP. If you are a newbie in Penetration Testing and afraid of OSCP preparation, do not worry. Glasgow Smile2 is supposed to be a kind of gym for OSCP machines. The machine is designed to be a DC tribute but also a kind of real life techniques container. You will find also a bunch of ctf style challanges. You need to have enough information about Linux enumeration, PTES and encryption for privileges escalation.
    About the VM
